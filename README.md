# Dynamic-Customer-Segmentation-Engine


This project involved developing a dynamic segmentation engine to analyze over 40,000 customer profiles and uncover spending behavior patterns. Using clustering techniques such as k-means and Gaussian Mixture Models, customers were grouped into actionable segments based on their purchasing habits and preferences. A recommendation layer was built on top of these clusters, enabling personalized product suggestions and cross-sell opportunities. The system boosted cross-sell effectiveness by 20% and optimized marketing targeting strategies. Overall, the engine provided a scalable and data-driven approach to enhance customer engagement and drive business growth
